## Prerequisites
- Windows Operating System
- RapidQ Framework : [https://rapidq.phatcode.net/](https://rapidq.phatcode.net/download/index.html)

## Installation Steps

1. Download and extract RapidQ to C:/rapidq/

2. Copy all FlyTools sources to the RapidQ directory:
   ```
   C:/rapidq/
   ├── Flytools.bas
   ├── bitmaps/
   ├── includes/
   └── icons/
   ```

3. Compile FlyTools:
   - Open Command Prompt
   - Navigate to `c:/rapidq/`
   - Type: `rc.exe Flytools.bas`
   - This will generate the executable file

*Note: If you prefer not to compile, a tested installer (2006 version) is available. The RapidQ code has proven reliable even after 20 years!*
