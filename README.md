## Overview

FlyTools is a comprehensive aviation utility software designed for light aircraft pilots, providing a range of computational and reference tools.

From the innovative Psion Series 3 with EPOC to Windows desktop application, FlyTools embodies the remarkable evolution of portable computing and aviation software.

### Historical Context
FlyTools has a fascinating origin story. Initially developed in 1999, the first version was created for the [Psion Series 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_3), a groundbreaking handheld computer running the EPOC operating system. These compact devices were revolutionary for their time, offering powerful computing capabilities in a portable form factor that made them incredibly popular among professionals, including pilots.

The Psion Series 3 was renowned for its robust design, efficient EPOC operating system (developed by Psion), and remarkable functionality for a pocket-sized device. Pilots particularly appreciated its ability to perform quick calculations, store navigation data, and serve as a reliable on-the-go computing companion.

As computing landscapes shifted, FlyTools evolved from this Psion Series 3 platform to a Windows desktop application. This 25th Anniversary re-issue release is created for educational and learning purposes, serving as a testament to the software's journey and the technological transitions of late 1990s computing.

### Interface Characteristics
The interface is a time capsule of early software design, but the underlying computational logic remains solid and instructive.
Users will notice:
- Classic Windows GUI elements
- Bitmap-based toolbars and icons
- Fixed-size windows
- Limited ergonomic considerations typical of the era

### Learning Opportunities
While the interface may appear outdated, the true value of FlyTools lies in its educational potential:
- Calculation algorithms that remain accurate
- Clear, straightforward code structure
- Practical example of full-featured Windows application development
- Insights into early 2000s programming techniques
- Demonstration of modular software design in Basic

## Database Approach: A Historical Perspective

One of the most intriguing aspects of FlyTools is its custom database implementation, which is now considered obsolete but remains an excellent educational resource for understanding basic data management techniques:

### Custom File-Based Database Characteristics
- **Storage Method**: Flat file-based storage
- **Data Persistence**: Manual read/write operations
- **No Relational Database Engine**
- **Direct File Manipulation**

#### Learning Opportunities
For developers interested in understanding basic database techniques, this approach offers insights into:
- Manual data serialization
- File I/O operations
- Simple data storage and retrieval mechanisms
- Low-level data management without modern ORM or database frameworks

### Recommended Modern Alternatives
- SQLite, MySQL,...
- JSON-based storage
- Cloud-based database solutions

## Installation
1. Download the FlyTools executable
2. Optional: Configure preferences through the application

## Legacy Note
The software is presented as-is and with humility. It has no real usages, but rather aims to provide insight into software development techniques of its time and offer a practical tool for aviation enthusiasts. This is a legacy codebase maintained for educational purposes. While functional on modern Windows systems, it uses the RapidQ framework which is no longer actively maintained.
